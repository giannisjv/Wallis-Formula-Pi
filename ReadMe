Hello everyone this is my point of view about Wallis formula for finding Pi.
I hope that it will help someone out there.
I initialy wanted to upload it because i didn't found something on web.

Because of the math lib you have to run it on gcc with -lm

compiling $ gcc opm-Pi-wallis.c -o omp-Pi-wallis -fopenmp
runnung   $ ./omp-Pi-wallis
I just wanted to measure the time my pc would take to run it!!
